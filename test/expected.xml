    <title>Wright article</title>
		<p>In Obsidian Entertainment’s 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> (2022), the
player takes on the role of artist Andreas Maler. Andreas (and therefore
the player) begins the game working on his masterpiece, anxious for
success, while simultaneously working in the scriptorium of Kiersau
Abbey on the outskirts of the fictional sixteenth-century Bavarian town
of Tassing. Andreas soon becomes embroiled in a series of murders that
players must work to solve, their potential lines of investigation
influenced by decisions they make about the protagonist’s experience,
European wanderings, and educational background.

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> therefore highlights the role of player
choice and divergent (though still limited) narrative outcomes. To this
end, the game’s launch trailer promotes the game with lines such as
“mysteries … only you can solve,” “choices … only you can make,” and “a
story … only you can uncover”
(fig. 1).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>

			<graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="Fig1.png" />
		</fig>
		<p>But as the narrative unfolds, it becomes apparent that players are
really investigating the mysterious true origins of Tassing and
Kiersau—and the stakes in telling the town’s (hi)story. Both characters
and the player in 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> interpret, remember, and
represent the past, for numerous (often personal) reasons. But these
reinterpretations and representations coexist and compete with other
interpretations, claims, and negotiations of the past in the present,
creating, as one review put it, “layers of
history.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> The game’s very title
reflects that this is its central preoccupation: a pentimento, from the
Italian 
			<italic>pentirsi</italic>, “means to repent or change your
mind.” Thus, as an artistic technique, it “is a change made by the
artist during the process of painting … usually hidden beneath a
subsequent paint layer.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref>
		</p>
		<p>As a contemporary historical game made by a known developer (and
backed by Microsoft), 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> is remarkable because
of its deliberate reflexivity on the nature of history as a process and
practice and of the writing of history as layers built up over time by
different people with competing perspectives and motivations. The game
appears to be an attempt by developers to embody a deconstructionist
approach to historical engagement, and to do so in a more thoughtful way
than many other mainstream historical games. As defined by Alun Munslow,
such an approach is considered more critical and reflective than
outmoded and conservative reconstructionist approaches which claim to
represent the past so-called objectively because deconstructionism is
“characterised by its concern with pointing to the subjective nature of
historical representation itself.” As Adam Chapman further expands,
“few, if any, historical games” seem to have been made with a
deconstructionist approach in mind, for reasons related to both the
medium itself and individual games’ commercial
viability.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> As a result,

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> has already drawn historians’
attention.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref>
		</p>
		<p>Even before the game’s release, promotional and critical discourse
around 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> sought to engage potential players in
the construction (and value) of the game’s historical representation and
its complexities. Marketing emphasized, and reviewer discourse
reinforced, that the game makes the player feel part of history. As
articulated by both the development team and subsequently reviewers,
history was not characterized as something static, much as it is
understood by those who study the past professionally. History is not a
fixed outcome of a stable past that is still possible to know or locate.
History, and historical discourse, is always layered and complex,
competing and shifting—grappled with and used for a variety of different
purposes by different people at different
times.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref> Such an approach strongly
reflects broader understandings of historical practice and writing as an
interpretation always already composed from the vantage point of the
present and based on individual choices of interpretation and
selection—discussed as part of the philosophy of history as far back as
the work of E. H. Carr.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">7</xref>
		</p>
		<p>That said, and despite the importance of this complexity to the
game’s identity and critical reception, much of this promotional and
review discourse also sought to make a claim for the authenticity of the
game’s representation of the early modern world—that Obsidian had
created a game that remained faithful to historical source material. The
notion of authenticity hangs like a specter above the marketing of many
historical games.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref> It is an
important but equally amorphous concept for historical game reception,
with little stable consensus on how the term is perceived and applied by
different stakeholders, and it is often used interchangeably with other
terms that lack shared meaning (such as 
			<italic>accuracy</italic> or

			<italic>realism</italic>).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref> The
term’s slipperiness and subjectivity results in the need to understand
authenticity not as an inherent property of a game but as a claim made
on behalf of it by someone (developer, marketer, reviewer, player, etc.)
that might be received positively or negatively—an active process
Richard A. Peterson refers to as “authenticity
work.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10">10</xref>
		</p>
		<p>Some explicit declarations of authenticity surrounded the discourse
on 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>. For example, one review’s subtitle
indicated that “despite a few blemishes, Pentiment delivers an
authentic, realistic portrayal of 16th-century Bavarian life with a
gorgeous art style,” elsewhere also remarking that its “academic
appreciation for historical authenticity through its dialogue and art
style is impressive and
original.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">11</xref> Yet even when they
did not use the term directly, developer-generated promotional materials
and subsequent reviews and other forms of commentary can still be
understood as attempts to construct, or weigh up, the game’s
authenticity. This article discusses the way that developers, marketers,
and reviewers alike sought to construct a discourse of authenticity
around 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> before and after its release, and how
they did so by layering different historical discourses onto
foundational explanations of what experience players could expect from
the game
		</p>
		<p>A layered approach to the use of history—with an overarching goal of
negotiating expectations for authenticity—is something we can observe in
the promotional discourses around historical video games more broadly, a
trend that 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> fits neatly into. I have elsewhere
proposed that we can consider three distinct but interlocking conceptual
ways in which history is used in the marketing of historical video
games. These different layers create discourses we might broadly
categorize as 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic>,

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>around</italic>, and

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in.</italic>
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12">12</xref> To
summarize this framework briefly, 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> encompasses the range of references often “made in
paratextual spaces to a company’s previous products, as a way of
creat[ing] expectations for ‘authenticity’ (and quality) by association
with brand image.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13">13</xref> Second,

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>around</italic> involves paratextual
discourses that make “intertextual connections out to other cultural
reference points,” perhaps to other games or wider media, and how this
fleshes out the game’s historical representation or
experience.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14">14</xref> Finally,

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in</italic> involves highlighting
“historical anchor points,” by a developer, critic, or other
stakeholder, offering players insights and creating expectations for the
representations of the past that they might find within a given game,
and the developer’s approach to doing
history.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15">15</xref> These layers work
together to create multiple historical access points for audiences, but
they also shore up claims about a game’s quality and supposed
authenticity in different ways.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16">16</xref>
They often intertwine with each other, but much of the discourse we
might characterize as 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> and

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>around</italic> tends to support and
underpin the weight of 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in</italic> and
the legitimacy of a developer’s engagement with the past.
		</p>
		<p>This article explores the ways that the paratextual discourses around

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> emphasized the inherently constructed nature
of historical representations while paradoxically selling the
reconstruction of an authentic history of sixteenth-century Europe via
stress on the replication of visual and material culture from the
period. In doing so, it adds to the growing body of research that takes
the paratextual discourses around historical video games seriously,
considering them vital to our understanding of the way games negotiate
meaning from the past.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17">17</xref> The
corpus of material for this article consists mainly of two distinct
types of digital paratext: (1) those generated by the developer
(Obsidian Entertainment) and publisher (Microsoft); and (2) critical
reviews of the game,
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18">18</xref> or pre- and
postrelease features published in the gaming and entertainment press,
including interviews with members of the development team.
		</p>
		<p>These sources of paratextual content, which players may encounter
before, during, or after experiencing a game, speak to and about it: one
produced and managed by developers, publishers, and marketers, and
another that arises in response to game releases. Though the product of
adjacent industries, they are intrinsically related, and the principal
function of both kinds of content overlaps significantly: to frame and
shape player expectations and experience. Game promotional materials
generated by developers and publishers, and reviews and features written
by critics and published by gaming and entertainment media outlets, both
work to create and manage expectations as gatekeepers or intermediaries
who attempt to negotiate meaning for potential
players.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19">19</xref> In this sense, both
kinds of sources are what Martin Barker describes as “prefigurative” or
“performative” framing content, Jonathan Gray as “entryway paratexts,”
and Jason Mittell as “orienting
paratexts.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20">20</xref> In all senses, these
texts have an ultimate goal of engaging an audience, and negotiating and
influencing the potential experience, meaning, and value of a
game—whether they do so successfully or not. These sources are distinct
but ultimately connected points in a wider discursive web that forms the
terrain of video game production and consumption. They are part of “the
whole range of wider connected textual phenomenon [that] draws our
attention to [a game] as an object of and for play,” as Ed Vollans
summarizes, drawing on a broad range of theoretical explorations of
video game and media (para)textuality from Mia Consalvo to T. L. Taylor,
Stephen Heath, and Nick Couldry.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21">21</xref>
Making connections between their content is a vital aspect of the “need
to study how all the circulating prior information, talk, images and
debates generate and shape expectations which will influence” how an
audience responds to any form of
media.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22">22</xref> In this sense, paying
attention to how these sources reflect and layer different historical
aspects of any given game and its wider historical context, and how they
work (explicitly or otherwise) to create expectations about
authenticity, allows us to understand reception of this concept as an
active process of perception management rather than a static value. Such
paratextual sources then have both “pragmatic” and “evaluative”
functions in that they are attempts at both “controlling and managing
the work’s overall public reception,” as well as “claiming or demanding
value and cultural significance” for a game, as Annika Rockenberger
argues.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23">23</xref>
		</p>
		<p>A primary focus on these sources helps us to move beyond
often-implicit assumptions that the game itself is the central object of
importance and most significant site of meaning when we explore the
relationship between games and
history.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24">24</xref> It recognizes that
gameplay “doesn’t exist in a vacuum” and that a range of different texts
do as much, if not more, to explore what it means to represent and
engage with the past in video
games.

		</p>
		<p>Promotional materials that feature developer commentary are
particularly important for understanding the role that the

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> a developer plays in the
game’s marketing and reception. Foregrounding the company and/or
individuals involved in a game’s production figures prominently in game
promotion and criticism. It is often used as a guarantee of quality (or
occasionally, statements to the opposite effect) but also provides
insights into “important information about the influences and the
history of the production.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27">27</xref>
Leora Hadas’s notion of “promotional authorship” underscores that
individuals’ or entire studios’ identities are often mobilized to tap
into “deeply embedded cultural ideas and narratives about genius and
expression, the authentic and the fake, and power relations in the
construction of meaning around the texts of popular
culture.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28">28</xref> Likewise, Nick Webber
has conveyed the importance of authorship within understandings of
(para)textuality relating to historical
games.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29">29</xref> Thus, the

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> a company can guarantee
quality (or specific qualities) and manage expectations.
		</p>
		<p>Obsidian’s experience as a studio, and some of its well-known games,
are a core part of 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> discourse. A behind-the-scenes video uploaded to
Obsidian’s YouTube channel promises to take viewers “behind the ink,”
exploring the design and development of script, font, and art style
vital to its narrative and visual design. The video opens with Josh
Sawyer, 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s creative director, discussing his
desire to make the game, connecting it specifically to Obsidian’s
profile as a developer: “When I got in the game industry, I was like
‘you know, I’d really like to make a historical game.’ Obsidian is kind
of known for making very complex, mechanical games. Games that are
focused on story, focused on
characters.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30">30</xref> Reviews and
features likewise describe the studio as a “renowned role-playing game
developer,” with Sawyer as their “star
director.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31">31</xref> Articles similarly
refer to the game as “a passion project for lead designer Josh Sawyer”
or otherwise “a passion project for the developers at Obsidian,”
including art director Hannah Kennedy’s Deep Dive feature for website
Game Developer.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32">32</xref>
		</p>
		<p>
			<bold>[Insert Figure 2 here].</bold>
		</p>
		<p>Sawyer is central to this discourse not simply because he was

			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s creative director but also because of his
own experience and reputation as lead designer and project director of
the “much loved” 
			<italic>Fallout:</italic>
			<italic>New</italic>
			<italic>Vegas</italic> (2010).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33">33</xref>
That game isn’t specifically mentioned in “Behind the Ink,” but a shot
early in the video (while Sawyer narrates Obsidian’s history as a
developer of story-focused games) zooms in on a model of a Brotherhood
of Steel suit of armor—a prominent icon from the franchise looming large
over discussion of the developer’s brand identity
(fig. 2).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34">34</xref> Critical discussions
of 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> frequently mention

			<italic>Fallout:</italic>
			<italic>New</italic>
			<italic>Vegas</italic>,
and Sawyer’s involvement in it, often name-checking it in titles of
features or reviews. For example, a review for Polygon is titled
“Obsidian’s Murder Mystery Pentiment Is Full of Tough, Fallout-Style
Choices,” and subtitled “As in New Vegas, There Are No Perfect
Outcomes.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35">35</xref> The reviewer judges
that the game’s conclusion feels “very much in keeping with the best of
Obsidian’s previous work, like 
			<italic>Fallout:</italic>
			<italic>New</italic>
			<italic>Vegas</italic>, in that there’s no easy
choices, no ‘best’ options that will lead to the ‘good’
ending.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36">36</xref>
			<italic>New</italic>
			<italic>Vegas</italic> is elsewhere held up as an example of the sorts
of games Obsidian is good at making: “known for producing high quality
stories and characters through its storied history as a developer” with
a “blend of combat and dialogue trees that place[s] an emphasis on
choices and their impacts.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37">37</xref> An
IGN interview with Sawyer noted that 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> will
explore “a number of the same themes” as games like 
			<italic>New</italic>
			<italic>Vegas</italic>, such as “death, social transformation, and class
conflict.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38">38</xref>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> is viewed as a game that very much follows in
these footsteps and “plays to their
strengths.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39">39</xref> A popular, existing
product is here emphasized as an example that proves Obsidian’s mettle
in developing nuanced, narrative-driven games, laying the groundwork of
expectation for what 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> hoped to achieve in
reception.
		</p>
		<p>But this discourse can work in the opposite direction, too, while
still in 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s favor. That the game has “a much
narrower scope than Obsidian’s other RPGs, which strive to depict entire
cities, states, even continents” is viewed positively, in that
“Pentiment can spend more of its time on making the small things
matter.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40">40</xref> Indeed, elsewhere the
game’s uniqueness and rarity are praised: “A game like Pentiment doesn’t
come around often. Top developers like Obsidian Entertainment usually
leave smaller productions like this on the editing
floor.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41">41</xref> That

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> is unlike many of Obsidian’s grander scale
projects links to another important way in which a discourse of
authenticity was being constructed: that it was developed in an
intrinsically different way from most AAA games. One review described it
as “heedfully crafted,” while noting that “a small team of thirteen
developers at Obsidian Entertainment” worked on
it.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42">42</xref> Even if the reviewer didn’t
enjoy the game’s art style, they still appreciated that “you can feel
the experience and
craftsmanship.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43">43</xref> Critics
ultimately saw that 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s production
limitations—a small development team, no voice acting, and a minuscule
budget—aided rather than detracted from the game.
		</p>
		<p>This discourse also attempts to draw some of the legitimacy, and
indeed authenticity, from the aesthetic and identity of independent game
development. It suggests that a small team, working with care and
passion, could elevate a game’s value and achievements. As Jesper Juul
notes, while definitions of independent game are far from agreed upon,
independent digital games operate in relation to particular “early
twenty-first-century ideas of authenticity” that revolve around
qualities such as “the analog, the local, the personal, the physical,
and the handcrafted.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44">44</xref>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> also tries to capture much about the early
modern period’s visual and print culture through the care and attention
the developers paid to emulating the handcrafted appearance of the
myriad details of illuminated manuscripts.
		</p>
		<p>The game is replete with elements that connote the craft and artistry
of books and other forms of visual and material culture. For example,
the pages of an imagined manuscript are the platform upon which the game
unfolds. The game first requires that players remove the existing layer
of script and artwork from the manuscript’s first page by rubbing a
stone against it, rendering it blank to craft their own new layer of
history upon it. At specific points during play, they can choose to zoom
out of a given scene, revealing that it is an illustration for a
chronicle of Andreas’s life and deeds and is written on these pages in
Latin script. Marginalia comprising illustrations and text accompanies
each frame, and page, providing the player with broader historical
context, such as explaining the relevance of people, places, and events
to the way the game interfaces with the larger history of
sixteenth-century Europe (fig. 3). Some marginalia, however,
historicizes fictionalized elements of the game—invented, but
narratively significant to the history of Tassing and Kiersau—affording
them a veneer of authenticity alongside annotations that describe real
historical details (fig. 4).</p>
		<p>
			<bold>INSERT FIGS. 3 &amp; 4 HERE.</bold>
		</p>
		<p>Animations that seem to turn these pages mechanically depict the
player’s progress and navigation around the game world, giving the
overall effect of the player advancing Andreas’s story and constructing
this chronicle as they interact with the game and make choices about
narrative progress and game-space exploration. In this sense, there are
dual functions here: to create an analog, handcrafted look and feel and
to emphasize the player-historian’s role in constructing this
(hi)story.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45">45</xref>
		</p>
		<p>Calling 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> an 
			<italic>independent</italic>
game seems tenuous given Obsidian’s status as an established developer
of commercial games that had been acquired by no less than Microsoft in
2018.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46">46</xref> Nonetheless, website
Destructoid’s feature connects these diverging threads in one
paragraph:
		</p>
		<disp-quote>
			<p>The one thing about 
				<italic>Pentiment</italic> that comes across
  the strongest after only minutes of playing it is that this [game] was
  made with so, so much love. The game is the love child of Obsidian
  game designer and 
				<italic>Pentiment</italic> director Josh Sawyer, who
  worked on classics like 
				<italic>Fallout:</italic>
				<italic>New</italic>
				<italic>Vegas</italic> and 
				<italic>Pillars</italic>
				<italic>of</italic>
				<italic>Eternity</italic>. The game was pitches
  [
				<italic>sic</italic>] years ago, but the fact that it was finally
  made after all this time and with such care is a testament to the
  strength of the premise, and to the dedication that went into bringing
  it to life. …
			</p>
			<p>For years, one of my biggest hopes for the games industry is that
  larger studios with big teams and seemingly endless resources would
  break off into smaller teams and bring their passion projects to
  life—it seems that’s exactly what Obsidian did in this
  situation.
				<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47">47</xref>
			</p>
		</disp-quote>
		<p>Ultimately, such a discourse works to legitimize the game as a
product of, effectively, a safe pair of hands. For an untested
intellectual property—and something unconventional for both the
developer and industry more broadly—this is crucial. Indeed, as one
reviewer remarked, “For a not insignificant portion of my time with it,
I wondered if I’d be giving Pentiment the benefit of the doubt to this
extent if it wasn’t made by Obsidian. The answer is that probably I
wouldn’t, and that ironically I’d probably have given up on it just
before the legendary RPG studio’s qualities really come to the fore.”
Ultimately, the review judged that “it’s hard to imagine this game
conveying such authority in its historical detail if it came from
another developer, either. I don’t know the first thing about 16th
century Europe, but I believe what Obsidian’s telling me about
it.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48">48</xref> It is not just a general
value and sense of authenticity being ascribed to the game’s
development, then; more importantly, the game’s historical
representation is trusted because the team behind it can be trusted.

			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49">49</xref>
		</p>
		<p>Alongside the importance of a developer’s brand identity and history,
explicit reference to other popular media texts is also a key part of
the discourse around any forthcoming video game. Both a game’s promotion
and critical reception often clearly attempt to place the new title
within a broader intertextual web of popular culture. In part, this
contextualizing is an attempt to convey certain qualities of a potential
game experience, based on assumptions potential players might have from
previous experience of, or interests in, popular
media.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50">50</xref> In no small part, this is
due to the fact that developers of historical games, “with and without
scholarly training[,] employ a broad set of sources, including other
games, to design and build historical events and
processes.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51">51</xref> But it is also an
attempt to ensure quality—or indeed, construct claims of authenticity.

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> was no exception to this.
		</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> reviewers bring a broad array of texts
into their discussions. For instance, given the game’s murder-mystery
framing, several reviews reference well-known literary-historical
detectives. These range from Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot and
Frogware’s recent 
			<italic>Sherlock</italic>
			<italic>Holmes</italic>
series to other famous pop-cultural sleuths: “You’re running around the
village like Columbo in a
tunic.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52">52</xref> One review alludes to

			<italic>Cadfael</italic>, a late-1990s British television mystery series
based on Ellis Peters’s series of historical mystery novels,

			<italic>The</italic>
			<italic>Cadfael</italic>
			<italic>Chronicles</italic>. It portrays a twelfth-century Benedictine
monk as a murder-solving detective, a premise closer in some respects to

			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s setting and characters than the other
notable modern sleuths.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53">53</xref> Such
examples broadly position the game within the genre of murder mystery
and investigation, suggesting that it would be a satisfying take on
expected generic conventions.
		</p>
		<p>However, Sawyer repeatedly locates 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> more
widely into the history of narrative-focused video games. Interviews and
other features mention that the 1992 MicroProse title

			<italic>Darklands</italic>, with its fifteenth-century setting and
reliance on historical source material, served as Sawyer’s primary
inspiration for the way 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> incorporates
traditional historical
knowledge.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54">54</xref> One feature notes
that Sawyer “fell in love with [
			<italic>Darklands</italic>’s] approach
to historical fiction, and as he went on to get a degree in history and
subsequently work in games, the idea of a historical fiction game stuck
with him.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55">55</xref> The game uses social
classes so that players can use their specific backgrounds and skills to
“
			<italic>speak</italic>
			<italic>common,</italic>
			<italic>speak</italic>
			<italic>Latin,</italic>
			<italic>ride</italic>
			<italic>horse</italic>,”
and so on. These are reflected in the way that, in

			<italic>Pentiment</italic>, the players are told explicitly that their
choice of background, education, and interests will “affect your
character’s choices going forward,” influencing dialogue options and
narrative outcomes
(fig. 5)

		<p>
			<bold>[Insert Figure 5 here]</bold>
		</p>
		<p>There are thus other traces of 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s
discursive positioning as an indie game in its promotion. As Juul
writes, when indie games reference “older visual styles,” this “carries
a deeper meaning because independent games, though new, tend to claim,
explicitly or implicitly, to go back to an earlier and better time: to
the beginning of video game history,” to “simpler games” made by fewer
people.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57">57</xref> Taking design cues from
a (much) older game Sawyer had a personal connection to, and this being
a frequently repeated talking point, is an attempt to construct

			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s authenticity as a successor historical
fiction and role-playing game.
		</p>
		<p>But beyond the game’s important influence on Sawyer, his experience
of 
			<italic>Darklands</italic>’s paratextual materials also inspired a
notable feature of 
			<italic>Pentiment’s</italic> promotion. In an IGN
feature interview with Rebekah Valentine, Sawyer noted that
		</p>
		<disp-quote>
			<p>Arnold Hendrick, [the lead designer on 
				<italic>Darklands</italic>]
  ... included a bibliography in the manual for Darklands, and a number
  of the books in his bibliography I bought and have on my shelf … I
  could find where he got his information, and get that source myself,
  and then use that for my own work. I just wanted, if someone at the
  end of [
				<italic>Pentiment</italic>] is like, “Wow, I love this,
  history sounds great.” I want them to be able to have the same
  opportunity I had where I played Darklands, and I'm like, “Oh, where
  did all this stuff come from?” It came from here, here’s all the
  reference material, just check it
  out.
				<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58">58</xref>
			</p>
		</disp-quote>
		<p>The game here functions as a jumping-off point for a player
interested in expanding their knowledge of the historical period that it
speaks to. Moreover, such a strategy also positions a game within a
wider web of legitimate historical research that it is based on and
inspired by, conferring the authority of historical scholarship onto the
game’s reinterpretation of it. Following in 
			<italic>Darklands</italic>’s
(and Hendrick’s) footsteps, five days before the game’s release, the

			<italic>Xbox</italic>
			<italic>Wire</italic> blog published “A
Recommended Reading List of Late Medieval History from Pentiment Game
Director Josh Sawyer.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59">59</xref> Among
screenshots from the forthcoming game, the article mentioned a range of
academic books, accompanied by Sawyer’s commentary, which offered a
personal perspective on their relevance and significance. Prominent
among these recommendations were Natalie Zemon Davis’s

			<italic>The</italic>
			<italic>Return</italic>
			<italic>of</italic>
			<italic>Martin</italic>
			<italic>Guerre</italic> (1983), Carlo Ginzburg’s

Umberto Eco’s historical novel 
			<italic>The</italic>
			<italic>Name</italic>
			<italic>of</italic>
			<italic>the</italic>
			<italic>Rose</italic> (1983), the latter designated “a huge inspiration
for Pentiment.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60">60</xref> Reviews and
interviews with Sawyer frequently evoked this work of historical
fiction.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61">61</xref> Christian Donlan went
so far as to observe that, at least to begin with, “Pentiment is a bit
of a Name of the Rose simulator”
(fig. 6).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62">62</xref>

			<bold>[Insert Figure 6 here]</bold>
		</p>
		<p>But beyond just being points of interest a player might decide to
further explore, these recommendations have a common, microhistorical
approach to their subject matter. Many descriptions explicitly detail
how the featured books value the experiences of singular
ordinary-yet-remarkable people and explore them (and their immediate
geographic or social context) in extreme
depth.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63">63</xref> Each book touches on a
different aspect of 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s interpretation and
representation of early modern Europe—from traveling artists, to the
mysterious disappearance and reappearance of so-called changed men (in a
quest called “The Return of Martin Bauer” that deliberately nods to
Zemon Davies), peasant uprisings, and a variety of atypical or eccentric
individuals. Sawyer’s commentary on the books also offers a sense of a
particular historiographical intervention, with Sawyer occupying the
position of
“developer-historian.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64">64</xref>
Discussing 
			<italic>The</italic>
			<italic>Cheese</italic>
			<italic>and</italic>
			<italic>the</italic>
			<italic>Worms</italic>, Sawyer
writes that “
			<italic>Ginzburg</italic>

original).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65">65</xref>
		</p>
		<p>This latter point is particularly important. A thread about the
oddity of the past and people’s lives runs through many of these
citations. It is elsewhere reflected in other forms of promotion, like
the “Behind the Ink” YouTube video, very early in which Sawyer states
“if I’m really focusing on telling a story more than mechanics, the
weirdest fiction we can come up with in some cases just doesn’t hold a
candle to the weird stuff that’s actually happened in
history.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66">66</xref> Rebekah Valentine’s
feature/interview for IGN echoes this point and refers to the
recommended reading list: that in drawing inspiration from such works’
cast of interesting historical figures, 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> is “a
game that promises to be chock full of such ordinary extraordinary
tales.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67">67</xref>
		</p>
		<p>The incorporation of these historical texts into the game’s
promotional surround, and their framing as recommendations from a game’s
creative executives, is strikingly similar to the use of such discourse
in the marketing of other historical
games.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68">68</xref> It functions essentially
as an annotated bibliography, seeking to both gain player interest and
establish another level of historical authenticity around the game by
demonstrating that it draws heavily on traditional, academically
produced historical knowledge. Some features note that the use of
historical consultants (“with PhDs”) and the team’s “robust amount of
research” make 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> “ripe for usage in an academic
environment.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69">69</xref> But this discourse
still chiefly hinges on the sort of 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> discourse that center Sawyer in the capacity of
developer-historian, or perhaps also auteur: “While he’s had a storied
career working on hits like Fallout: New Vegas … Sawyer’s been
ruminating on an historical game for a long, long time. His published
reading list for Pentiment enthusiasts hearkens back to his college
days; he tells me that working from it to develop Pentiment is ‘like
going back to the greatest hits of my tour of studying early modern
Europe in college.’”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70">70</xref> Sawyer’s
own study of medieval and early modern history is emphasized in other
postrelease interviews, too, such as a feature with

			<italic>Wired</italic> in which he recounts his college days. In doing
so, Sawyer takes time to dispel some of the myths and misunderstandings
of the period as “one long, uninterrupted period of nothing happening,
or just wars or whatever,” and that actually, it is one that is much
more complex than collective understandings of it might suggest:
“There’s so much social change going on. Changing religious
institutions, academic institutions, social structures. Capitalism
starts to sort of barely emerge. There’s a lot of cross-cultural
contact, because of trade that takes people across the world. So this
period has always been really interesting to me, just because of
everything that’s going on.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71">71</xref>
Valentine describes the recommended reading list as having “the joyous
feel of a syllabus, based around preparing for a course on 16th-century
European history and life.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72">72</xref>
Likening such a piece of promotional material to a pedagogical exercise
is further evidence of the role the developer, as historian, occupies in
promotional discourses explicitly designed to mobilize historical
evidence and connote
authenticity.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73">73</xref> Doing so, on the
one hand, entices players—particularly those already interested in
history. But it also works to induct them into the developer’s specific
interpretation of a particular historical event—or in this case, style
of historical writing to which the game also aspires. This works in
close contact with the kinds of promotional and critical discourses that
elevate individual or a small number of creative executives into an
authorial role; here, a key figure like Sawyer speaks with authority
about the game’s historical touchstones and his own knowledge of the
past it engages.
		</p>
		<p>Mirroring the prerelease recommended reading list, the game itself
also has a bibliography of references in its closing credits (fig. 6).
Much greater in volume and scope, this list bookends the prerelease
annotated bibliography with further assurances of research, and thus
historical quality. The broader inspiration that the development team
has taken from the history 
			<italic>of</italic> historical
games—particularly RPGs like 
			<italic>Darklands—</italic>works to not
only authenticate 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s engagement with the past
by association with other video games, but also with other, more
legitimate historical source material. The bibliography mimics the
conventions of academic history by providing references to support the
game’s overall argument. Making a direct connection to

			<italic>Darklands</italic> and its precedent-setting inclusion of a
bibliography, and how unusual it is for contemporary games like

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> to follow suit, Austin Suther notes that the
“credits of Pentiment is [
			<italic>sic</italic>] proof of Obsidian
Entertainment’s dedication to historical accuracy”
(fig. 7).

		<p>In an interview with Waypoint Radio, Josh Sawyer described

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> as “

			<italic>The</italic>

			<italic>of</italic>
			<italic>the</italic>
			<italic>Rose</italic>.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75">75</xref> This
epitomizes attempts to draw on both the cultural capital of a narrative
RPG style established by other acclaimed indie games (an identity that

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> was consciously positioned as sharing, albeit
paradoxically), with the established historical capital of respected
works of microhistory. This demonstrates the importance of a discourse
designed to curate a constellation of sources that form a layer of

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>around</italic> a game and, indeed, its
importance to constructed claims and reception of an authentic
engagement with 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in</italic>
			<italic>Pentiment.</italic> It is also where we begin to feel the
tension between the game’s de- and reconstructionist epistemological
positions—wanting it both ways in accounting for and eschewing
historical complexity.

		</p>
		<p>Most of the discussion we might position within the

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>of</italic> and

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>around</italic> layers directly informs
the way that 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in</italic> a game is
discussed and marketed. The build-up of identity for the game’s studio
and director, and their history and experience, as well as the web of
historical and cultural intertextual reference points that encompassed
the game’s release all create specific access points that construct a
sense of authenticity around 
			<italic>Pentiment—</italic>both as a
worthwhile game experience and as a historical intervention with
something meaningful to say about its subject matter.
		</p>
		<p>But as noted, at its core 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> also strongly
reflects on the practice of history itself, deconstructing the
relationship between a past that existed and what we come to remember
and represent about it, for conflicting reasons. This is also
fundamental to the game’s narrative and the way such an approach frames
the choices that players can make about piecing it together. For
example, at the outset of the third act of 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>,
the player witnesses a conversation between father and daughter Claus
and Magdalene Drucker, the owners of a printing shop in Tassing. In
consultation with the town council, Claus has been made responsible for
painting a memorial in the town hall immortalizing Tassing’s history.
For various reasons linked to the overarching story of the game—as it
spans almost three decades between 1518 and 1543—what this memorial
should include about the town’s past and present has become contentious
and a source of frustration for Claus. The conversation proceeds as
follows:
		</p>
		<disp-quote>
			<p>
				<bold>Claus</bold>: Those men don’t know what they want. When I
  tell them what I’m trying to do, they get scared. … They talk all day
  and we’re never any closer to a decision. I’m sick of it, sick of the
  whole thing. … I’ve spent my whole life illustrating and printing
  other peoples’ stories. For the first time, I feel like this is my
  story to tell.
			</p>
			<p>
				<bold>Magdalene</bold>: I didn’t know it was so important to
  you.
			</p>
			<p>
				<bold>Claus</bold>: We hear all of these stories about what this
  place was, how it came to be. And it feels like history is something
  that happened before, happened to other people. But eighteen years
  ago, we lived through something, you and I—everyone in Tassing.
  Everyone wants to forget about it, pretend it didn’t happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				<bold>Magdalene</bold>: You don’t.
			</p>
			<p>
				<bold>Claus</bold>: No, I don’t.
			</p>
		</disp-quote>
		<p>Claus has been deeply affected by his role in traumatic past events
that involved people from both Tassing and Kiersau. He laments the way
that people seek to portray the history of those events in a sanitized
way so that it won’t anger the local lord or visitors. When Magdalene
reminds him that he “can’t change it,” he affirms: “I know. The least I
can do is make sure it’s not forgotten. Something happened, we were part
of it. I need to help people remember that. If I don’t do it, who will?”
Instances like this throughout 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> continually
foreground that this game is keen for players to understand that the
relationship between the past and representations of it is not
uncomplicated but always a product of interpretation and alteration—what
someone chooses to remember allows others to remember, and why. The
eventual mural representing the history of Tassing is unveiled at the
close of the game. The specific images memorialized in each of the
triptych’s panels are subject to change, determined by the choices the
player makes about what to include, who they speak to, and what they
spend time exploring throughout 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s final act.
In this sense, gameplay action also foregrounds the subjective,
constructed nature of history and the consequences of the decisions made
in the process.
		</p>
		<p>This approach was part of the game’s promotion, too, especially when
drawing other prominent historical voices into this discourse. For
example, Sawyer evoked Hilary Mantel’s approach to writing historical
fiction in two interviews, citing the following quote while making a
point about 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s construction of the past:
“Facts are not truth, though they are part of it—information is not
knowledge. And history is not the past—it is the method we have evolved
of organizing our ignorance of the past. It’s the record of what’s left
on the record.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77">77</xref> He also points
out that “history doesn’t really exist,” presumably making a broader
claim that the past is already something that we have lost and cannot
hope to reconstitute with the completeness that many official, dominant
historical narratives—and, indeed, historical media—may claim. As a
result, the team’s approach to creating a meaningful historical fiction
was less about deferring to so-called facts than it was to create a
believable historical place, informed by the records available to them.
The game espouses a more nuanced engagement with the fundamental
question of what history is, how people relate to it, so a more critical
look at its inherent subjectiveness was thus vital to the
developer-generated discourse around the game, using the work of
historical writers like Mantel (and Zemon Davis, Ginzburg, and Eco) as a
source of legitimation for their design choices.
		</p>
		<p>This is also a thematic engagement that resonated strongly with
critics in their experience of the game, and it became a central
observation of many reviews. One feature wrote that the game, and the
kinds of historical texts it draws inspiration from, “invite[s]
audiences to examine history through something other than the lofty lens
we’re used to it being filtered
through.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78">78</xref> Referencing the game’s
title, another feature noted that “
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s aim is
to show how history, like oil on a canvas, can be covered, then
rediscovered or forgotten.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79">79</xref>
Jordan Rameé added a personal layer to their reflections on the game,
and history:
		</p>
		<disp-quote>
			<p>I loved reading history books growing up, especially those written
  more like a storied account of what happened as opposed to straight
  facts on the page. There’s an implied truth to history when it’s told
  moreso as a story, as it admits that there’s no objective truth to the
  past. History is simply what we make of it. Pentiment is written
  around this idea, providing a means of exploring a point in history
  from an outsider’s perspective—the protagonist is not native to the
  region and we, the player, aren’t native to the time period. Rather
  than simply retell history, Pentiment affords the chance to influence
  it, and in doing so, delves into the subjectivity of historical
  record.
				<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80">80</xref>
			</p>
		</disp-quote>
		<p>Donlan extends this broader point about power and history to how the
game seems to argue more specifically about aspects and agents of the
period, such as the power of the Catholic Church to control accepted
narratives. By focusing on “the act of writing” and situating Andreas as
an artist working in a scriptorium, the game argues that “this room and
rooms like it were once key to the church’s power. They owned the books
and they made the books. And they could make books disappear.”
Ultimately, as Donlan writes, “the pleasures and the politics of text
and of books are everywhere” in 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>, but the game
is also concerned with larger questions about authorship, power, and
history: “Who gets to decide what is true? Who gets to write it down,
and what lies beneath those
words?”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81">81</xref> Referring to the
influence of the “engine of class struggle” as an underlying factor (and
a key theme of the game itself), Joshua Wollens likewise notes that “the
people of Tassing make their own history, but they don’t make it as they
please.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82">82</xref> Indeed, some reviews
link the game’s critical look at history to its success; for example,
Jay Castello observes that “even though Pentiment is set in the past, it
demonstrates how history is never static, and how it influences places,
communities, and individuals. That’s something that’s easily lost when
we look back through time, but Pentiment’s living characters and
spiralling mystery won’t let you forget
it.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83">83</xref> Rob Zacny maintains that
“this is the more mature and interesting version of ‘historical
accuracy’ than we so often get, complicating an image many of us have of
the past but without resorting to facile winks at modern
sensibilities.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84">84</xref> A high
proportion of critical perspectives on the game then convey a sense of
the game’s success in making the reviewers (as players) reflect on the
notion that neither games, nor any other kind of historical
representation, have an uncomplicated relationship to the alleged facts
of the past and the complexities of the process of making history to
begin with.
		</p>
		<p>However, in acute tension with this, aspects of

			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s promotional discourse were simultaneously
attempting to construct a sense of the game’s authenticity vis-à-vis a
real past—projecting more of a reconstructionist epistemological
approach. As explored by Chapman, games that adopt a “realist
simulation” style (as 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> does, like many
successful mainstream historical games) “aim and claim to

			<italic>show</italic> the past ‘how it was,’” captured objectively and
authentically by the developer-historian, a claim often reinforced in
promotional materials.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85">85</xref> The
“Behind the Ink” feature historicized the game’s context in this way,
suggesting that 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> would be educational and
capture an authentic sense of the period, from era-appropriate artwork
and art style that Obsidian was attempting to preserve, to the social,
cultural, and political context of sixteenth-century Bavaria
(fig. 8).
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86">86</xref> The game’s official
reveal trailer claimed that 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> was “a narrative
adventure that brings the past to
life.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87">87</xref> The

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>around</italic> discourse that
emphasized the team’s research in the development process clearly
attempts to confer authority on the way the game engages and represents
the period.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88">88</xref>
		</p>
		<p>
			<bold>[Insert Figure 8 here]</bold>
		</p>
		<p>Perpetuating this, reviewers also praised the developer’s
representation of a very specific past, despite the game’s
fictionalizations. Echoing developer-created promotional materials, many
reviews praised 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s success in offering a kind
of “living history” (a term that frequently reappears), and how it
embodies a microhistorical approach— that the player spends a large
amount of time among the people of these small microcosms learning a
great deal about their daily lives.. Reviewers noted that Pentiment’s
fictions of both the people and the setting appeared convincingly real:
“though the characters are inventions of the writers, they give voice to
the real people who lived through these unforgiving times,” that the
game accomplishes something “rare among historically set video games. …
it gives you the feel of the 
			<italic>real</italic> personality of its
era,” making it more “believable” than many other games with historical
settings.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89">89</xref>
		</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s visual design also lends credibility to
this “effect of reality” and its supposed basis in historical
truth:
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90">90</xref> “Like every other aspect
of the game, the basis of the visuals is painstaking research, and it
shows.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91">91</xref> Leana Hafer’s review
exemplifies the often lavish praise for the developer’s achievement in
creating something that resonated with players: “The whole production
really feels like a love letter from some serious medieval history fans
to all the like-minded players such as myself. … Every step of the way,
I felt like I was geeking out about one of my special interests
alongside the writers and
artists.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92">92</xref>
		</p>
		<p>Several different elements of the game were positioned in promotional
materials as important to its success in building a sense of the
historical world and Andreas’s perspective. This included, as a frequent
observation, discussions of the use of font and script in the game to
connote Andreas’s perceptions of other characters’ status, class, and
education: “My god, the fonts. Never before has a game made such
conscious and incredible use of
fonts.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93">93</xref> Music was equally
important given the lack of voice acting in the game: one review praised
the game’s incorporation of “a few achingly authentic bits of hymnal
music.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94">94</xref>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s limited score was also a feature of the
game’s marketing postrelease, with an 
			<italic>Xbox</italic>
			<italic>Wire</italic> article promoting the forthcoming release of a
vinyl recording comprised of original music created for the game, a
collaboration between the development team and “early music ensemble
Alkemie.” The blog post highlighted their use of “shawms, hurdy-gurdies,
and myriad other period instruments” to compose and adapt “historical
pieces from the 14th to 16th centuries for pivotal moments throughout
the story.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95">95</xref> The blog speaks of
attempts to take “the commitment to authenticity further” by
incorporating not only artwork by art director Hannah Kennedy, but also
a painting by artist Benjamin Vierling, “who uses a renaissance-inspired
Mischtechnik, alternating layers of oil paint and egg tempera” and
creates a portrait of Andreas that included a pentimento beneath it “for
full thematic resonance.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96">96</xref> Once
again, the analog and discourse of handcrafted content are brought to
the fore to make explicit claims about authenticity.
		</p>
		<p>In these promotional materials, such audiovisual aspects of

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> were transformed into discrete “capitalizable
elements,” to use Barbara Klinger’s term—multiple points of interest (or
“digressions”) that might entice an
audience.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97">97</xref> But these parts
ultimately all work together to promote a game experience with
constituent, authentic parts and make subtle claims about the game’s
authenticity because of their connection to analog processes and things.
For instance, the game space looks like the pages of a manuscript,
complete with illustrations and marginalia, while Latin script retells
the game’s story. The sound of quill scratching on paper accompanies the
animation of dialogue between the characters. Likewise, the game uses
historical instruments and music, ultimately pressed onto vinyl, as a
product for players to
purchase..
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98">98</xref> The marketing of this
game, as a product of this most contemporary digital medium, sought to
rely on some of the oldest forms of analog media to stake a claim for
its authenticity. Much like the clams of the game’s production being
similar to that of independent game development, this is also a
fundamental marker of quality and meaning

			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99">99</xref> This emphasis also reduces the
complexities of history, and the history of early modern material and
visual culture, into an authoritative look and feel, suggesting that
this is possible to do at all.. The necessity of developing

			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s unique audiovisual design requires a
simplification and approximation of a broader, multifaceted history of
artistic technique and print culture, as well as a specific kind of
music that seem authentic to the time and place, rather than allowing
for greater historical variety. Trying to capture the essence of a
particular historical style presumes, and implicitly suggests, that

			<italic>a</italic>
			<italic>singular</italic> historical essence exists.
In this sense, while a significant proportion of the discussion of the
approach to doing 
			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in</italic>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> sought to account for historical complexity,
the demands of crafting a unique and commercial historical game push
promotional and review discourse toward reconstructionist tendencies and
away from truly consistent deconstructionist approaches.
		</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> has thus sparked a variety of discussions
and evaluations of its engagement with a certain past. In ways distinct
from other mainstream historical games, critics reflected on the nature
of history itself and the role memory, selection, and power play in its
construction. It is an impressive feat for a mainstream game to
encourage such critical reflection rather than general observations
about a game’s supposed authenticity. However, neither the game’s
promotion nor critical reception escape the need for authenticity to be
the standard by which historical games are judged. Even though not all
reviews or promotional materials deployed the term, it still casts a
shadow as a benchmark used to connote 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>’s
successes and ultimate value as a contemporary video game. It therefore
aptly reflects Chapman’s lament that commercial video games rarely adopt
deconstructionist approaches.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100">100</xref>
Understanding the way that developers promote and reviewers evaluate

			<italic>history</italic>
			<italic>in</italic> a video game, we see the
importance of understanding the way the other kinds of historical
discourse are key to the production and reception of the past in a game
and, in particular, its perceived authentic qualities.
		</p>
		<p>
			<bold>Conclusions</bold>
		</p>
		<p>The potential of games to function as a form of historical
representation has long been explored, and games are often found to be
wanting in their engagement with the past because they are so often
unlike academic history.
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101">101</xref>
			<italic>Pentiment</italic> is noteworthy because it is a game that
sought to shed light on the complexity of history and memory and thus
engage with the past in a way that was more critical than usual.
Moreover, these ideas featured prominently in the promotional discourse
around the game. Considering the ways that different aspects of a
historical game are identified, isolated, and dispersed through a range
of digital paratexts allows us to see that history in games is complex
and can be interpreted in several ways but always requires a layered
approach.
		</p>
		<p>By applying this framework to 
			<italic>Pentiment</italic>, I endeavor
to propose a way of conceptualizing the myriad ways that history, and
historical discourses, are used in the promotion of historical video
games. Doing so recognizes that when game makers, marketers, and/or
critics discuss a game’s historical resonances, this is not a neat and
simple process of merely pointing our factual historical aspects and
where they may (or may not) appear in a game; it is, rather, as complex
as the very nature of what history is, as a discourse built up of
multiple competing representations of the past. Moreover, these
categories of historical discourse—
			<italic>of</italic>,

			<italic>in</italic>, 
			<italic>around</italic>—are not neat themselves.
They often overlap and collide, combining in multiple ways, because
history itself is not inherently neat and isolated—it is always a
process and result of of subjective interpretation.
		</p>
		<p>By acknowledging, as part of its branding, marketing, and gameplay,
that history is not the past, that evidence is incomplete, and
narratives are created and codified for different reasons,

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> ultimately demonstrates the potential for
historical games to embody deconstructionist historical approaches.
However, this is complicated by considering that even when a game like

			<italic>Pentiment</italic> tries to offer a more nuanced understanding
of history’s relationship with the past, the promotion and critical
reception of the game do not shed certain kinds of baggage. Namely, a
game is still judged and positioned amid claims of authenticity,
ultimately appealing to a broader sense that there is a past to be
reconstructed. There are clear declarations made—by different
agents—about an interpretation based on facts, an attempt (however in
vain) to approach some kind of truth about the past, and the critical
response to the game conferred authority on the developer to do so in a
way that seemed believable. As Sawyer explained, “we tried to make it as
accurate as possible … while also understanding we are making a
fictional story to kind of illuminate the truth of the of the time
period.”
			<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102">102</xref> There is an inherent
tension then between what we might read as deconstructionist and
reconstructionist intentions and impulses and how they guide both design
decisions and the creation of marketing discourses.
		</p>
		<p>This is therefore a paradox of historical video games—that they still
need to trade on the currency of their claimed authenticity to assert
their worth, despite attempts to move more thoughtfully beyond what is
usually expected of a mainstream game’s engagement with the past. To do
so, competing kinds of history are mobilized, deployed, and layered on
top of each other, in the hope that the game will be perceived by
potential players as a valuable engagement worth their investment—to
play in the version of the past that, with all of its limitations, a
developer has
(de)constructed.
