# Changelog

All notable changes to the DOCX to JATS XML Converter will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- Post-processing function `flatten_table_blockquotes()` to handle complex table cell structures in JATS XML output
- Support for converting markdown blockquotes within table cells to OJS-compatible format

### Fixed
- **Table rendering in OJS**: Tables with blockquote content in cells now render correctly
  - Removed nested `<disp-quote>` elements that OJS doesn't support in table cells
  - Removed multiple `<p>` elements per cell that OJS strips during rendering
  - Removed `<break />` and `<br />` elements that OJS sanitizes from table cells
  - Citations in table cells now separated by semicolons for readability
- Table cells now use direct text content without paragraph wrappers for OJS compatibility

### Changed
- Table cell processing in markdown → JATS conversion pipeline:
  1. Detects and removes `<disp-quote>` elements from table cells
  2. Flattens multiple `<p>` elements into single text content
  3. Joins multiple paragraphs with semicolon separators (`; `)
  4. Preserves inline formatting (`<italic>`, etc.)

### Technical Details
**Problem:** Pandoc converts markdown blockquotes (`>`) in table cells to JATS `<disp-quote>` elements wrapped in `<p>` tags. OJS sanitizes these block-level elements from table cells during JATS→HTML rendering, causing content to disappear.

**Solution:** Post-process JATS XML to flatten table cell content by extracting paragraph contents, removing block-level wrapper elements, and concatenating with semicolon separators while maintaining inline formatting.

**Result:** Table cells render properly in OJS with readable, semicolon-separated citations.
